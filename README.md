# Please Get Rid of My Checkmark

Bought Twitter Blue ("X Premium" as the big guy wants us to call it) so you dont need any ads and saw that you can just hide your checkmark? Me too. Then big guy took that feature away leaving us in shame. Thats why I made this!

Twitter removes your checkmark after updating your profile name or profile picture so they can manually review it. What if we just cosntantly update it (every hour) so you never have your checkmark again! (While still keeping all the other Twitter Blue features of course)
