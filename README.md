# Please Get Rid of My Checkmark

Did you buy Twitter Blue (sorry, *ahem,* "X Premium") to get rid of ads--but don't want the shame of having a blue checkmark on your profile? Me too! And believe it or not, that *used* to be a feature.

Then the big guy (you know who) took that feature away, leaving us stuck with a badge of shame. So, I built this!

### How it works

Twitter removes your checkmark whenever you update your profile name or picture, because those actions trigger a "manual review."

This project takes advantage of that by automatically updating your profile every hour--keeping the checkmark off your account while still letting you enjoy all the other Twitter Blue perks.

No more checkmark. No more shame.
